>> Jem Young: Now I'll briefly talk about how to install Redis just in case you want to. We don't have to because we're not gonna use it today. But just in the future if you need to install it, sudo apt install redis-server. We're gonna modify the redis.conf, we're gonna modify the supervised line to systemd.

[00:00:17]
So what we're doing is we're adding it to the system daemon, so that it will always come online when the system restarts. Remember yesterday someone asked about services, what are services, someone did. When we talked about services, when I say sudo nginx service, etc., using the systemctl, that's a lower layer of services.

[00:00:39]
Think of the difference between IP tables and the UFW, the uncomplicated firewall. That's the equivalent of services and systemctl. The syntax is a bit more verbose, but it gives you a bit finer grain control. So if you ever see that you just think, it's the same thing as service, just a little bit more modified.

And if you wanna run Redis with your Node setup, I used Node Redis, I use it at work. It's a pretty good library for interfacing with Redis. Same thing for MySQL. If you wanna install that, sudo apt install mysql-server. Then you run setup mysql_secure_installation and it'll run you through some sane defaults.

And if you wanna use that with your Node you can use mysqljs which is pretty good. It works well.
