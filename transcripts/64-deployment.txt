>> Jem Young: And the last section on containers and general load balancing engine x tweaking this advanced things is deployments. We talked about orchestration as a way of deploying containers. But if we weren't using micro services and containers, what's a faster way of deploying 20 servers? I don't necessarily wanna go through Jem Young's full stack for front end course and be like then I copy my SSH key over.

And then I wanna run all these scripts to install everything. You have to do that every time 20 times. That's not scalable. Fortunately, there are tools out there that you set up a configuration scripts. And you give it some resources and some server IPs and you can set up hundreds or thousands of servers at once.

[00:00:42]
So the more popular tools to be answerable vagrant and puppet or chef is another one. These are really popular tools for spinning up 20 servers are taking down 20 servers, hundreds servers, and thousands of servers. When you get really good, you'll just take everything that we did earlier and you put it in the scripts and then you just roll that out every single time.

[00:01:03]
And because remember, at the end of the day, the best engineers are the laziest ones. So if you can script all that repeated work that we did configuring engine x and all these things into one simple scripts, that just makes your life much, much easier.
