>> Jem Young: The other one is, another thing with Nginx is adding a subdomain. Yesterday we created a server block for our servers, and that's what's known as a virtual host. So I could create ten different domains and ten different servers on one Nginx configuration. And depending on the url that I'm trying to hit, Nginx will redirect me to the right place.

[00:00:22]
So in this case I created a subdomain called test.jemisthe.best. And a side note, I regret doing jem is the best because it just doesn't roll off the tongue like jem.party. Maybe in V3 I'll do jem.party. Or Jem knows how to party, I don't know. But what's great about Nginx is we can have as many domains as we want.

[00:00:46]
And we can have as many servers as we want, because in terms of your mental model, this is a server on its own. In terms of programming, this is a server on its own. In terms of paying for money, you only have one server. So that's great. You have infinite servers here available.

[00:01:02]
Later in the course, we're going to create a subdomain just like this. And we're going to pipe it to our server. And then we're going to create an application that just lives on that subdomain rather than our main domain. But for now, this is how you had a subdomain in, not too hard.

[00:01:18]
Any questions on this? Because this is kind of important. But we can reference back later. And if you're wondering what these double colon and brackets, it's not really a smiley face. I don't know, It's, I'm trying to think if there's an emoji that matches this, two people with a hat and a beard.

[00:01:37]
I don't know. That's just IPv6 notation. Remember yesterday we learned that because we ran out of IP addresses, we had to create IPv6, which would give us 304 undecillion, which is a lot of zeros. And the fact that I remembered that, but I can't remember how to properly do a find just shows you I'm not perfect.
